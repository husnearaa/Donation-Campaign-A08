# Donation Campaign Project

## Features

### 1. Donation Campaign Categories

In this section, the Donation Campaign Project offers four distinct categories for users to make donations: Education, Health, Food, and Clothing. Users can select their preferred category to make a donation. Upon selecting a category, they will be directed to a page displaying detailed information about that donation. Users can read the details and choose to donate by clicking the "Donate" button. It's important to note that users can donate within the same campaign category only once.

### 2. Donated Campaigns

In this section, the project displays a list of previously donated campaigns. If the list of donated campaigns exceeds four items, a "Show All" button is provided. Clicking on this button reveals the complete history of donated campaigns. Users can access detailed information about each donated campaign by clicking on the "View Details" button.

### 3. Donated Statistics

The Donation Campaign Project includes a graphical representation in the form of a pie chart to illustrate important statistics related to donations. This chart showcases both the total amount of donations collected and the contributions made by individual users. The data for this chart is collected from the donation campaigns.
